<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and driven technology graduate from Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, 
  currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering with a 7.3/10 CGPA. With a strong foundation in programming 
  languages like Python, C, and Java, along with expertise in core concepts such as DSA, OOPs, OS, and DBMS,
  I thrive in dynamic, tech-driven environments. My goal is to leverage my skills in innovative projects
  while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies.</p>

<p>My project experience reflects my ability to blend creativity with technical proficiency. I developed a Facial 
  Feature Emotion Recognition and Interactive AI system using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and DeepFace, enabling 
  real-time emotion classification and dynamic AI responses. Additionally, I built an Employee Management System 
  with MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to streamline record-keeping, and a personal portfolio website as part of 
  a Google Developer Student Club initiative, showcasing my web development skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I am eager to contribute to meaningful tech solutions while growing professionally. My academic journey—spanning
  a 9.7/10 CGPA in secondary school and an 8.3/10 CGPA in intermediate education at Sri Chaithanya—has instilled in
  me a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence. With hands-on experience in web development, database 
  management, and deep learning, I am excited to take on challenging roles where I can make a tangible impact.</p>
